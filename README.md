:arrow_right: Go to the web app: https://yymao.github.io/decals-image-list-tool/

This web app displays image cutouts for a list of sky coordinates,
and allows you to inspect and mark selections on the images.
It is similar to the [SDSS Image List Tool](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/tools/chart/listinfo.aspx),
but specifically designed for target selection and inspection.

The image cutouts are retrieved from the
[DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys](https://legacysurvey.org/) (which also includes DES, SDSS, HSC, etc.),
[Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS)](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/),
and the [STScI Digitized Sky Survey (DSS)](https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form).
