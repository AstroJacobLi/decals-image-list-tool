# Galary: Galaxy gallery made easy

## Instruction
This current version of Galary only works if you have a Princeton tigressdata account. Please download/clone this repo to `/tigress/your_net_id/public_html`, then change the `GAlARY_PATH` in `config.js` file to your catalog directory. Then you can go to `https://tigressdata.princeton.edu/~your_net_id/galary/#YOUR_FOLDER/YOUR_FILE.txt` to use the app.

This work is based on Yao-Yuan Mao's [decals-image-list-tool](https://yymao.github.io/decals-image-list-tool/).
:arrow_right: Go to the web app: https://yymao.github.io/decals-image-list-tool/

This web app displays image cutouts for a list of sky coordinates,
and allows you to inspect and mark selections on the images.
It is similar to the [SDSS Image List Tool](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/en/tools/chart/listinfo.aspx),
but specifically designed for target selection and inspection.

The image cutouts are retrieved from the
[DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Sky Viewer](https://www.legacysurvey.org/viewer)
(which also [includes WISE, GALEX, DES, SDSS, HSC, etc.](https://www.legacysurvey.org/acknowledgment/)),
the [Sloan Digital Sky Surveys (SDSS)](https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr16/),
and the [STScI Digitized Sky Survey (DSS)](https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/dss_form).
